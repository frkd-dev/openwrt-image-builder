= Automated and customizable OpenWRT x86/64 Image Builder

This repository hosts GitHub actions for automated builds of customizable OpenWRT x86/64 images.

Want a OpenWRT x86/64 image with your packages/files/scripts?
It's easy as 1-2-3:

. Fork this repo.
. Make a copy `config.example.yaml` â†’ `config.yaml` with your edits.
. Start `OpenWRT Release Checker` action.

...or grab a release if you are fine with a current package set.

IMPORTANT: This repository is NOT a fork of OpenWRT.

== Motivation

While an official {openwrt-fwsel} provides a good for most cases customizable image builder,
it has a limitation on a rootfs partition size which is 104 MByte.
It's a huge limitation on how many packages you can put into an image.

This is a "no-go" situation if your aim is to get a ready-to-go image with a lot of packages for a router and app server system running on x86-64 architecture.
This image builder removes these limits and also provides automated builds of newer releases with easy to use YAML configuration.

**Goals are:**

. Automated builds of customized and ready-to-use OpenWRT x86/64 image for a **personal** homelab environment.
. Provide *as thin as possible* YAML configuration wrapper around the official OpenWRT image builder.
. Provide an offsite place for downloads of customized images based on **stable** OpenWRT releases.
. Provide a forkable repository (template) for building personalized OpenWRT x86/64 images.

**Non-goals are:**

. Support architectures other than x86/64. Custom images for embedded devices with heavily constrained resources can be easily built using the official {openwrt-fwsel}.
. Create a replacement for the official OpenWRT image builder.
. Provide builds of pre-release images.
. Provide a wide range of packages that fits everyone and all sorts of tasks. Fork this repo and build your own image.

== Images

The builder produces only images with the following characteristics:

Partition format:: EXT4
Image type:: combined EFI `.img.gz`
Architecture:: Generic x86/64

GitHub actions configured to check https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/releases[official OpenWRT releases] and as soon as a new one is available, the new customized image will be released.

To avoid GitHub abuse and keep repository space usage low, this repository will keep only latest 10 image releases.

== Configuration

The image builder is configured via `config.yaml` file.
If the file is not present, the builder will use `config.example.yaml` file.
This helps to have customized configurations in forked repositories without conflicts with this repository.

Check example of configuration with comments in link:config.example.yaml[] file.

This configuration example adds driver for Intel X710 and Realtek RTL8125 NICs, as well as Docker, Samba, Wireguard, support for IPv4 to IPv6 transitional technologies, and bunch of other day-to-day utilities to make system more comfortable. Also, it removes NIC drivers that never will appear in my homelab environment, but that are coming in a default OpenWRT image, like: Amazon ENA, Broadcom, and AMD.

=== Files and scripts

If you need files/scripts built into the image, you can place them in `files/` directory of this repository.
The builder will copy them to the root of the image.
A good example would be a https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/uci-defaults[UCI defaults] a first-boot scripts.
For instance a `files/etc/uci-defaults/99-mynetwork` script that contains your custom network configuration will end up in `/etc/uci-defaults/99-mynetwork` in a rootfs and will be executed on a first boot.

== New features

The builder is mostly feature-complete as it's gained current goals.
The only missing "good to have" feature is support of qemu `qcow2` images.
Currently, there are no plans to add new features, as almost all goals are already met.
Features may be added once the OpenWRT image builder adds new capabilities.
